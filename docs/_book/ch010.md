## Introduction to Fault Attacks

Up until now in the course we learned about *passive* attacks –
i.e. attacks which measure *leakage* such as timing information and
power traces. The advantage of these attacks is that they allow an
attacker to acquire information in the process of an ongoing computation
e.g. an AES key *before* it was fully mixed with the input – this fact
can help the attacker extract secrets.

In fault attacks we will become *active* in the sense that we will give
the device-under-test (DUT) additional inputs such as heat or radiation.

One problem with Fault attacks is that they use the strongest attack
model, meaning – we assume most power on the attacker’s part.

## Active Attacks

<div id="definition" class="section level5" number="9.1.0.0.1">

##### Definition:

> *“A fault attack is an active attack that allows extraction of secret
> information from cryptographic devices by breaking those devices.”*

In fault attacks we, the attackers, are *active* – we give additional
inputs beside the main input such as:

-   Fuzzing (garbage or bad input)

-   Radiation

-   Heat

-   Vibration

-   Power spikes etc.

This way, we receive other (usually erroneous) outputs which might give
us additional information about the computation and/or the secret. This
process is described in .

</figure>

Like with passive attacks, some of these outputs can be acquired at
different stages of the computation process.

Many fault attacks are inspired by studies in the field of
*reliability*: a study in reliability will research a device’s physical
boundaries e.g. the maximum or minimum temperature under which it
performs reliably. Other examples of reliability studies are aimed at
improving device performance under extreme conditions such as:

-   Space and X-Rays

-   Dense CPU Layouts

-   Data Center Recovery (ECC-RAM)

A security researcher implementing fault attacks will, on the other
hand, purposefully subject the DUT to extreme conditions in order to
inject errors in the device’s functionality to achieve their goal. In
that sense, a reliability study of a given device can lay the
ground-work for the fault attacks to come.

### Breaking a device-under-test

How can *breaking* a device help an attacker?

1.  BORE – *“Break Once, Run Everywhere”*: Some device families share a
    single secret among all instances.

2.  Repairable Devices: Temporary breakage is fine. Sometimes restarting
    the device is enough to “repair” the damage.

3.  Partial breakage: Sometimes it’s convenient to break *part* of a
    device, for example – destroy the subsystem responsible for DRM
    verification.

</div>

</div>

<div id="sec:fault_attack_taxonomy" class="section level2" number="9.2">

## Fault Attack Taxonomy

The three ways we can examine a Fault Attack in order to understand it
are:

1.  Method - *“How to inject the fault?”*

2.  Properties - *“What class of fault to create?”*

3.  Target - *“Which part of the system to break?”*

<div id="subsec:fault_methods" class="section level3" number="9.2.1">

### Fault Methods

<div id="subsubsec:power_supply_attacks" class="section level4"
number="9.2.1.1">

#### Power Supply Attacks

What happens if the device is underpowered? As we have previously seen,
power in electronic devices is used to drive the CMOS transistors. If
the device is slightly underpowered it might fail to switch some of the
transistors and thus produce false calculations, and with even less
power it might struggle with getting into operational state (boot loop)
or even transition to an entirely faulty state. Another attack method
involving the power supply is injecting power spikes (to a similar
effect).

Some parts of a device are typically more sensitive to the power supply
than others, and thus under-powering or over-powering the device will
de-stabilize it and inject faults.

The obvious scenario for such an attack is when the DUT belongs to or is
being controlled by the attacker – for example if they’re examining
their own set-top box etc. In that case, the attacker can supply the
device with as much/little power as they wish.

Another example of such attack scenarios is in the field of RFID readers
– the device powering an RFID chip is the reader, so a *malicious* RFID
reader can over/under-power the chip to achieve various faulty results.
For instance, if the RNG is connected to the power supply, we can mike
its generated numbers deterministic.

</div>

<div id="subsubsec:clock_timing_attacks" class="section level4"
number="9.2.1.2">

#### Clock/Timing Attacks

The clock is typically a bus shared by many of the system’s components
which synchronizes the propagation of calculations through the system –
i.e. at the beginning all inputs are ready, and when there is a rising
edge on the clock bus they start propagating throughout the various
computational components. When all computations are finished they all
wait for the next rising edge on the clock bus in order to proceed to
the next stage. In a clock glitching attack the attacker would inject a
rising edge on the clock bus at an arbitrary time. This way only *some*
of the computations will have finished by that time while others are
still being processed, and thus the device will be in a faulty
(unstable) state.

A notable example is the attack on Mifare Classic RFID chips we talked
about in the beginning of the course <span class="citation"
cites="nohl2008"></span> – the RNG in the chip is dependent only on the
time between powering up the RFID tag and challenging it. An RFID reader
operated by the attacker can control both parameters, thus making the
generated challenges deterministic.

</div>

<div id="subsubsec:temperature_attacks" class="section level4"
number="9.2.1.3">

#### Temperature attacks

This attack method relies on the physical property of electrons
(current). Electrons “jump”, and the higher the temperature – they will
jump more frequently and to longer distances. If a device gets *too hot*
– enough electrons can “jump” over the insulation layer in a transistor,
for instance, to flip it from logical 1 to 0. This results in a fault.

Because of the ubiquity of devices failures due to temperature, nowadays
temperature sensors are integrated into most devices, so when it
overheats – the device will shut down.

An attacker can bypass the temperature sensor by disconnecting it.
Another method would be to quickly alternate the temperature of the
device from extremely high to extremely low, so that *on average* the
temperature is reasonable, but it will still experience faults during
the extreme phases of the cycles.

In an interesting research paper <span class="citation"
cites="appel"></span> a type-confusion attack on the Java
virtual-machine was demonstrated: at first, the entire memory was filled
with small arrays (say of size one). The Java VM is type-safe, so it is
normally impossible to access one of the memory regions using a pointer
to a different region. To inject a type-confusion fault the researchers
used a 50W light bulb to heat the memory chip of the device enough to
flip some of the bits (for illustration see ). As a result, a small
portion of the data-structures describing the arrays in memory now held
wrong values (e.g. changed their value from *s**i**z**e* = 1 to
*s**i**z**e* = 20). At this point, some affected data-structures
*contain* a header of a different data-structure, to which the attackers
now have read and write access. Changing the header of the second data
structure to an arbitrary value gave the attackers access to the
entirety of the device’s memory.

</div>

<div id="subsubsec:optical_electromagnetic" class="section level4"
number="9.2.1.4">

#### Optical, Electromagnetic

When a laser hits a transistor it changes the energy level of the
silicon inside, and sometimes it can change the transistor’s state.
Notably different wavelengths are absorbed by different materials, so in
a typical silicon chip different lasers will hit different layers of the
device etc. Magnetic/Electromagnetic radiation and pulses have similar
effects.

The underlying principal of those attacks is that the attacker
forcefully injects charge (energy) into the device. Once it’s stored
inside it will have to dissipate one way or another, so as a result it
injects a random faulty state into the device.

</div>

<div id="subsubsec:reading_from_ram" class="section level4"
number="9.2.1.5">

#### Reading from RAM

All of the attacks described above require very high engagement with the
DUT – in order for the attacker to control the power/clock sources, for
example, they sometimes would need to drill, cut or otherwise tamper
with the device. Shining a laser on a device requires at the very least
having it at a visible distance.

The final attack method involves only *reading* from memory, and thus is
very practical and requires very little physical engagement. This attack
method is called *Rowhammer* and is discussed later in the lecture.

<div id="subsec:fault_properties" class="section level3" number="9.2.2">

### Fault Properties

In this section we discuss:

1.  How controllable is the fault’s location/size? Precise? Loose? None?

2.  How controllable is the fault timing?

3.  What’s the fault’s duration? Transient? Permanent? Destructive?

<div id="subsubsec:destructive_fault_attacks_on_cryptographic_devices"
class="section level4 unnumbered">

#### Destructive fault attacks on cryptographic devices

What can be done with fault attacks to symmetric ciphers?

<div id="easy-example" class="section level5" number="9.2.2.0.1">

##### Easy example:

Imagine that we have a pile of cipher devices with a 64bit key length,
which work the following way: we can give the device a key and it tells
us whether it’s the right key.

What if we have a *destructive* fault attack that resets the top 32 bits
of a device’s key? We can brute force the key in 2 ⋅ 2<sup>31</sup>
instead of 2<sup>63</sup> (on average):

First we inject the fault into one of the devices and brute-force the
lower 32 bits of the key (*O*(2<sup>31</sup>)), then we pick another
device from the pile and brute-force only the higher 32 bits (another
*O*(2<sup>31</sup>)).

</div>

<div id="a-less-trivial-example" class="section level5"
number="9.2.2.0.2">

##### A less trivial example:

We have a public-key device which we can ZAP and one bit of the key
flips to zero.  
We can save all of the plaintexts-cipher pairs until we reach the one
matching an all zero key – which we can pre-calculate. This gives us the
Hamming weight of the key. Now we go back one plaintext-cipher pair – we
know that pair’s key’s Hamming Weight to be exactly one – meaning we
need to brute-force only *N* keys (*N* is the key bit-length). Now we
have the position of a single bit of the key.

If we iterate all the way backwards to the original plaintext-cipher
pair, we can acquire the key in *O*(*N*<sup>2</sup>) time!

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div id="subsec:fault_targets" class="section level3" number="9.2.3">

### Fault Target

What could be targeted by a fault attack?

1.  Input parameters (fuzzing, power and clock glitching)

2.  Storage (volatile/non-volatile)

    1.  HDD – Destructive (persists after reset)

    2.  RAM – Permanent

    3.  Cache – Transient

3.  Data processing: injecting a fault mid-computation and the device
    gives a different answer.

4.  Instruction Processing/Control Flow: inject a fault in the IP
    register and change the instruction flow. There are various examples
    that demonstrate the usefulness of this type of taget

    -   change the program counter to compromise control flow

    -   ARM32 instructions are very densely packed, thus there is a very
        high probability of hitting a valid instruction after flipping a
        single bit. For example, `jnz` and `jmp` are only one bit apart.

    -   Change for loop condition in programs such as one that reads
        from a buffer, if the loop is infinite, it would dump RAM
        contents including source code.

<div id="two-examples-of-fault-attacks-targeting-control-flow"
class="section level5" number="9.2.3.0.1">

##### Two examples of Fault Attacks targeting Control Flow:

1.  The CHDK hacking community, used to dump the firmwares of Canon
    cameras via blinking one of their LEDs <span class="citation"
    cites="chdk canon"></span>.

2.  The “Unlooper”: Back in the 90’s pay-tv devices started
    cryptographically signing the content, and if the cryptographic
    checksum did not check out – the device would enter an endless loop.
    The hacking community invented “unloopers” – a gadget that would
    inject a power spike and fault the IP register, so that the pay-tv
    device would jump to some other section of the code, from which
    point it would function normally.

<div id="sec:fault_attack_on_rsa_crt" class="section level2"

## Fault attack on RSA-CRT

<div id="subsec:rsa_decryption" class="section level3" number="9.3.1">

### RSA decryption

*n* = *p* ⋅ *q*, <span class="math inline">$M \\equiv C^d \\equiv M^{ed
\\pmod{\\phi(n)}} \\equiv M^1 \\equiv M \\pmod{n}$</span>

RSA decryption is hard!

Let’s speed it up using CRT (the Chinese Remainder Theorem):
Multiplication operations are *O*(\|*n*\|<sup>2</sup>). If we can do
operations (*m**o**d* *p*) and then (*m**o**d* *q*) instead
of (*m**o**d* *n*), we will reduce computation time by half.

<div id="explanation" class="section level5" number="9.3.1.0.1">

##### Explanation:

The bit-lengths of *p* and *q* are each half that of *n*
$$\|p\| = \|q\| = \\frac{1}{2}\|n\|$$
The computational complexity of multiplying by a number of length *x* is
(roughly) *O*(*x*<sup>2</sup>). Thus:
$$\\left. O(\|p\|^{2}) = O(\|q\|^{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}O(\|n\|^{2})\\Rightarrow(O(\|p\|^{2}) + O(\|q\|^{2})) = \\frac{1}{2}O(\|n\|^{2}) \\right.$$

So if we could multiply by *p* and *q* instead of by *n*, we would cut
*each* multiplication operation’s time complexity in half!

</div>

<div id="subsubsec:chinese_remainder_theorem" class="section level4"
number="9.3.1.1">

#### Chinese Remainder Theorem

<figure>
<img src="../media/file137.jpg" id="fig:chinese_remainder" alt="Chinese Remainder Theorem (Source: https://russinoff.com/papers/crt.html)" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Chinese Remainder Theorem (Source: <a href="https://russinoff.com/papers/crt.html">https://russinoff.com/papers/crt.html</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

The idea is that if we know both *x* (*m**o**d* *p*) and
*x* (*m**o**d* *q*) then we can easily calculate *x* (*m**o**d* *n*).

So, given a message *M*, calculate *M*<sub>*p*</sub> and
*M*<sub>*q*</sub>: <span class="math inline">$M\_p \\equiv C^d \\pmod{n}
\\equiv C^d \\pmod{p}$</span>, <span class="math inline">$M\_q \\equiv
C^d \\pmod{n} \\equiv C^d \\pmod{q}$</span>

To combine the values, we do:
*M*<sup>\*</sup> = *C**R**T*(*M*<sub>*p*</sub>, *M*<sub>*q*</sub>)=
*M*<sub>*p*</sub> ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*)) + *M*<sub>*q*</sub> ⋅ *p* ⋅ (*p*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *q*))

It is easily provable that
*M*<sup>\*</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*) = *M*<sub>*q*</sub> and
*M*<sup>\*</sup> (*m**o**d* *q*) = *M*<sub>*p*</sub>, so by the Chinese
Remainder Theorem, this value *must* be equal to *M*.

</div>

<div id="subsubsec:the_boneh_demillo_lipton_fault_attack_on_rsa_crt"
class="section level4" number="9.3.1.2">

#### The Boneh, DeMillo & Lipton Fault Attack on RSA-CRT <span class="citation" cites="boneh"></span>

The attacker has a decryption box (known plaintext scenario) with public
key *n* and would like to recover *d* (the private key). Additionally,
the attacker knows that the decryption box is decrypting using CRT.
Finally, let us assume that the attacker can inject a fault (any fault)
in the decryption process.

The attacker first gets
*M* = *M*<sub>*p*</sub> ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*)) + *M*<sub>*q*</sub> ⋅ *p* ⋅ (*p*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *q*))
through the regular decryption process.

Then, the attacker primes the device to re-calculate the message from
the same cipher, this time injecting a *transient fault* during the
calculation of *M*<sub>*p*</sub>, resulting in the device erroneously
producing *M*′<sub>*p*</sub> instead:
*M*′<sub>*p*</sub> ≠ *C*<sup>*d*</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*) The device will
then proceed to combine *M*′<sub>*p*</sub> with the correct result of
*M*<sub>*q*</sub>, resulting in:
*M*′ = *M*′<sub>*p*</sub> ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*)) + *M*<sub>*q*</sub> ⋅ *p* ⋅ (*p*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *q*))

Now the attacker can calculate the value of *M* − *M*′:
\[*M*<sub>*p*</sub> ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*)) + *M*<sub>*q*</sub> ⋅ *p* ⋅ (*p*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *q*))\]−
\[*M*′<sub>*p*</sub> ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*)) + *M*<sub>*q*</sub> ⋅ *p* ⋅ (*p*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *q*))\]=
(*M*<sub>*p*</sub> − *M*′<sub>*p*</sub>) ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*))

Finally, calculating the gcd  of *n* and *M* − *M*′ yields:
gcd (*n*, *M* − *M*′) = gcd (*p* ⋅ *q*, (*M*<sub>*p*</sub> − *M*′<sub>*p*</sub>) ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*))) = *q*

<div id="why-does-this-work" class="section level5" number="9.3.1.2.1">

##### Why does this work?

The greatest common divisor of *n* and anything can be only *p*, *q*,
*n* or 1. On the other hand, *M*<sub>*p*</sub> and *M*′<sub>*p*</sub>
can never be multiples of *p*, otherwise both would equal 0. So, by that
reasoning,
gcd (*p* ⋅ *q*, (*M*<sub>*p*</sub> − *M*′<sub>*p*</sub>) ⋅ *q* ⋅ (*q*<sup> − 1</sup> (*m**o**d* *p*)))
<u>must</u> equal *q*, and thus we have cracked the cipher using a
single fault attack.

A later paper co-written by Arjen Lenstra <span class="citation"

knowledge of *M*.

<div id="subsec:double_sided_rowhammer" class="section level3"
number="9.4.2">

### Double-sided Rowhammer

DRAM is the most common type of volatile memory. It is slow, dense and
cheap relatively to SRAM. Every bit of RAM is stored in a single
capacitor. Capacitors lose charge and they need to be periodically
refreshed. The bits are selected using the *row buffer*.  
The attack <span class="citation" cites="rowhammer"></span> utilizes the
physical structure of RAM chips in order to induce faults: Due to
parasitic leakage in DRAM capacitors, if enough consecutive reads are
performed on the immediately adjacent rows eventually a bit will flip in
the target row.  
The fault attack exploit code is as follows:

    while (true) {
        x = memory[address1];
        y = memory[address2];
    }

<div id="what-happens-here" class="section level5" number="9.4.2.0.1">

confusion.

number="9.4.2.1">

#### Challenges

<div id="the-challenge-of-cpu-caching" class="section level5"
number="9.4.2.1.1">

##### The challenge of CPU caching

The CPU cache prevents the same memory address to be read consecutively
from main memory, for performance reasons. To circumvent this
limitation, several techniques can be employed:

1.  Intel CPUs provide non-temporal read/write opcodes – special
    instructions that read from memory and don’t get cached.

2.  The special `clflush` instruction can be used to explicitly flush
    the cache after each read operation (privileged operation).

3.  Finally, cache-population algorithms had been extensively studied
    and reverse-engineered, so it is possible to arrange for *arbitrary*
    cache misses.

</div>

<div id="address-findings" class="section level5" number="9.4.2.1.2">

##### Address findings:

The attacker needs to find addresses that are on the same chip, and are
in adjacent rows for the attack to work.

### Countermeasures

<div id="refresh-rate-increase" class="section level5"
number="9.4.3.0.1">

##### Refresh-rate increase:

In order to overcome parasitic leakage, DRAM chips already have a
mechanism in place to read and then re-write the values stored in each
row periodically. One method of overcoming Rowhammer could be to
significantly increase the refresh-rate of the chip. This obviously
results in both performance degradation and increased power consumption.

</div>

<div id="ecc-ram" class="section level5" number="9.4.3.0.2">

##### ECC-RAM:

High-end DRAM chips (typically meant for data center environments)
contain error-correction coding (ECC) logic which can typically
*correct* one erroneous bit and *detect* two (at which point it will
crash the program/system). Those chips are immune to the basic form of
Rowhammer described above, but as discussed later, are not bullet-proof.

<div id="page-de-duplication" class="section level5" number="9.4.4.1.1">

##### Page de-duplication:

On modern systems, typically much memory is shared among many processes
running on the system. This is even more true of virtualized
environments where the guest and the host, for example, could run the
same OS. A common optimization is for the system to detect and
de-duplicate pages containing the same data, thus freeing up memory.

</div>

<div id="rowhammer-page-de-duplication" class="section level5"

##### Rowhammer + page de-duplication:

In a paper <span class="citation" cites="ffs"></span> researchers from
VUA demonstrated how they can utilize page-deduplication in a
virtualized environment to weaken cryptographic keys, resulting in
unauthorized access via OpenSSH, and breach of trust via forging GPG
signatures. The attack relies on the fact that the the attacker can
*read* a de-duplicated page as much as they want. The attacker has to
wait (or arrange) for a page containing sensitive information to be
de-duped, then hammer on it until a bit in the key flips, making it much
easier to factor.

In another paper <span class="citation" cites="eccploit"></span>
researchers from VUA showed how they can use Rowhammer to quickly flip
*enough* (typically three) bits on an ECC-RAM chip that error correction
will not be able to detect it, thus defeating the ECC mitigation. The
attack relies on the fact that error-correction takes time to compute,
and this gives the attacker a window of opportunity.

### Rowhammer-based attacks

#### RAMBleed

We will describe here Rowhammer based attack called RAMbleed which was
presented in  <span class="citation" cites="rambleed_paper"></span>.
While Rowhammer breaks data integrity, RAMBleed breaks also data
confidentiality by allow the attacker read unauthorized memory areas.
RAMBleed attack was implementes against OpenSSH server allowing the
attacker read RSA secret private keys.

<figure>
<img src="../media/file140.png" id="fig:rambleed_memory_layout" alt="RAMBleed memory layout" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">RAMBleed memory layout</figcaption>

In order to perform this attack, the attacker need to get to spesific
memory layout, as describe in . The attacker own A0, A1 and A2 block.
Then attacker force OpenSSH server to put its private RSA key in oranges
blocks by exploting linux buddy allocator which works in deterministic
way. Then the attacker repeatedly accessing A0 and A2 blocks - this will
access orange blocks as well because when DRAM access a part of the row,
it access the whole row as well. This will hammer the red block and
cause bit flips over there. The attacker can then read the red block-
because he own it, and gets the RSA secret key.

The performence from this paper shows accuracy of 82% when reading
OpenSSH host key. Reading the victim’s secret in 0.31 bits/seconds.

Suggested mitigations may be memory encryption, flushing keys from
memory, probabilistic memory allocator and Hardware mitigations such as
targeted row refresh and increasing refresh intervals.

        constant strive to improve energy efficiency, more specifically
        energy management mechanisms used in state-of-the-art mobile
        SoCs. The attack is based on overclocking CPU frequency to
        inject faults into the victim process and breach the isolated
        Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

        fault-based attack on the TrustZone - a TEE security approach
        deployed in ARM processors. This attack, as opposed to the
        frequency manipulation in CLKscrew, uses software-controlled
        voltage manipulation. It is demonstrated on an ARM-based
        multi-core processor and manages to achieve several malicious
        goals: (1) acquire an AES key by cryptanalysis, (2) induce
        misbehavior in RSA decryption method to fake signatures and load
        unauthorized applications into TrustZone. More on VoltJockey in
        the next section.

        corruption of integrity and confidentiality of Intel SGX
        enclaved computations. The authors demonstrate full key recovery
        PoC attacks against RSA-CRT and AES-NI.

-   **Speculative Fault Attacks** - Such attacks make use of the

        Kocher et al that describes a speculative fault attack that
        involves inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations
        that would not occur during correct program execution and which
        leak the victim’s confidential information via a side-channel to
        the adversary.

### VoltJockey

As mentioned above, VoltJockey <span class="citation"
cites="qiu2019voltjockey"></span> is a fault-injection attack, targeting
the TrustZone execution environment of ARM processors. VoltJockey was
deployed on the Krait multi-core processor, whose frequencies for each
core can be different. However, the processor voltage is controlled with
a shared hardware regulator, which introduces the main vulnerability
that is exploited in this attack. VoltJockey uses software-controlled
core frequency manipulation that is based on the susceptibility of DVFS.
The attack was demonstrated in two use-cases that breach the system-wide
secure technology in billions of ARM-based devices - TrustZone; (1)
obtaining AES key, and (2) forge RSA signatures of unauthorized and
possibly malicious applications. VoltJockey proved to be successful in a
commerical device, the Google Nexus 6, and has demonstrated its
dangerous implications in the secure execution environment TrustZone.

An illustration of the VoltJockey attack process can be found in
Figure [\[algo:voltjockey\]](#algo:voltjockey).
